# ACM-App

This is a temporary repository to work on Missouri S&amp;T's ACM App until I feel it is ready to be put in there repository. Basically a testbench for myself and others.

## Getting The Project Running

First I created the project using:
`expo init`

Then you will need to navigate to `/ACM-App` inside of the repository

Type `expo start` to begin using Expo, with Expo Go on your phone to live test changes.
