# ACM-App

This is a temporary repository to work on Missouri S&amp;T's ACM App until I feel it is ready to be put in there repository. Basically a testbench for myself and others.

## Getting The Project Running

First I created the project using:
`expo init`

Then you will need to navigate to `/ACM-App` inside of the repository

1. Run ``npm install`
2. If need type `npm audit --force` to fix any npm packages. _Note_ you maybe need to install expo after this step if so type `npm install -g expo-cli` (sudo may be need before command if using a Linux OS).
3. Type `expo start` to begin using Expo, with Expo Go on your phone to live test changes.
4. App should be running locally now.
